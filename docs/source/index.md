# Similator: Revolutionary Python-Rust Hybrid for Lightning-Fast Text Validation

Welcome to **Similator**, a hybrid Python-Rust library designed for ultra-fast text validation and comparison tasks. This project leverages the power of Rust to enhance performance while maintaining the flexibility and ease of use of Python.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Python-Rust Hybrid**: Combines Python's simplicity with Rust's performance.
- **Fast Text Comparison**: Leverages Rust functions for optimized text comparison and search.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple APIs to get started with text validation and data handling.

## üì¶ Project Structure

The project is composed of the following main files:

- **`text_similator.py`**: Contains the `TextSimilator` class, which integrates Rust functions for fast text comparison and search.
- **`valid_data.py`**: Contains the `ValidData` class, responsible for handling data validation tasks.
- **`memory.py`**: Contains the `Memory` class, which manages in-memory operations efficiently.
- **`lib.rs`**: The core Rust file exporting the `_rst_similator` module with `rst_compare` and `rst_search` functions.

## üìñ Documentation Contents

- [Installation](installation): How to install the Similator library.
- [Usage](usage): Examples of how to use the main classes and functions.
- [API Reference](api_reference): Detailed reference of the available classes and methods.
- [Contributing](contributing): Guidelines for contributing to the project.
