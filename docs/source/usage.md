# Usage Guide

This guide provides examples of how to use the **Similator** library for text comparison and validation using the `TextSimilator` class. 

## Initial Setup

To begin using Similator, you need to import the main class and set up some initial data.

### Importing the Necessary Classes

```python
from similator.text_similator import TextSimilator
from similator.valid_data import ValidData
```

### Creating a `ValidData` Instance

The `ValidData` class is used to manage collections of text strings that will be used for comparison and validation.

```python
# Example: Creating a ValidData instance
valid_strings = ["Hello", "World", "Text", "Example", "Python"]
valid_data_instance = ValidData(valid_strings, encoding='utf-8')
```

### Initializing `TextSimilator`

The `TextSimilator` class allows for powerful text comparison and search functionalities. You can initialize it with a `ValidData` instance or directly with a collection of strings.

```python
# Example: Initializing TextSimilator with a ValidData instance
text_simulator = TextSimilator(valid_data_instance, encoding='utf-8', case_sensitive=False)

# Alternatively, initialize it with a collection of strings
text_simulator = TextSimilator(valid_strings, encoding='utf-8', case_sensitive=False)
```

## Text Search with `TextSimilator`

The `search` method allows you to search for similar text within the provided data. You can specify a similarity threshold to control the sensitivity of the search.

```python
# Example: Searching for a text within valid data
search_value = "hello"
results = text_simulator.search(search_value, threshold=0.85)
print(results)  # Output: [('hello', 2.0)]
```

If `auto_cached` is set to `True` during initialization, search results will be cached, improving the performance of repeated searches with the same parameters.

## Text Comparison with `TextSimilator`

The `compare` method provides a similarity score between two strings, leveraging the Rust-optimized function for quick comparisons.

```python
# Example: Comparing two strings
value1 = "hello"
value2 = "hell"
similarity_score = text_simulator.compare(value1, value2)
print(similarity_score)  # Output: 1.94
```

## Using Rust Functions for Performance

The `TextSimilator` class integrates two key Rust functionsâ€”`rst_search` and `rst_compare`â€”to provide optimized performance for text search and comparison. These functions are seamlessly used within the Python class methods, providing a high-performance backend without additional complexity for the user.

```python
from similator._rst_similator import rst_compare, rst_search

valid_strings = ["Hello", "World", "Text", "Example", "Python"]
results = rst_search("Python", valid_strings, threshold=0.85)
print(results)  # Output: [('hello', 2.0)]
```

## Handling Empty Valid Data

If the `ValidData` instance is empty or not provided during a search operation, the `EmptyValidData` exception will be raised.

```python
# Example: Handling empty valid data
try:
    text_simulator = TextSimilator()  # No valid data provided
    text_simulator.search("example")
except EmptyValidData as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```
